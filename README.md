# poetry-analysis

Rule-based tool to extract repetition patterns and other lyric features from poetry, or other text data where the newline is a meaningful segment boundary.

This tool was developed for the [NORN project](https://www.hf.uio.no/iln/english/research/projects/norn-norwegian-romantic-nationalisms/index.html).
